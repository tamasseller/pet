@brief Helper template meta-programs.

Components that enable the efficient use of some overhead-free C++ features. 
This material is basically platform independent because these are completely source level constructs.
That is why the very same functionality is provided by other much more complete libraries.
However because this is a stripped down package compared to the ones like boost, it can be
verified much more easily that there is nothing in this code that is a no-no for tiny microcontroller projects.
