/**
 * Appendable multiple string storage.
 *
 * This storage provider is capable of storing multiple strings packed together into frames.
 * Useful for storing many strings highly varying in size.
 * Also provides spare configurable amount of spare space for each string, that could be used
 * for storing a header along with the strings (like HString for example).
 *
 * The storage can be modeled like this:
 *
 *  - There are multiple string objects in the storage.
 *  - Only the last one is available for modification, the others live as long as the container.
 *  - The last (active) one can be:
 *  	- Appended to -> store additional characters at the end,
 *  	- Dropped -> release the already acquired storage area,
 *  	- Peeked -> read back the already stored content,
 *  	- Commited -> make it fixed, successive calls will not alter its content or size.
 *
 *  Any string in the storage can be at most as big as a frame (minus the optional spare area),
 *  but multiple shorter strings are grouped together in a single frame. Only ever allocates
 *  whole frames at once.
 *
 * @tparam	frameSize The size of the frames in sizeof(char).
 * @tparam	spareSize The size of spare area per string in sizeof(char).
 * @tparam	Allocator The allocator used for the allocation of frames.
 *
 * @note	It is mainly supposed to be the lower layer of the Registry container, but probably
 * 			could be used for something else by itself too.
