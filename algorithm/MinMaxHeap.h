/**
 * Generic priority queue (min/max heap) logic.
 *
 * It is a fully abstract logic that implements the ordering
 * operations of a min/max heap or priority queue.
 *
 * It can be used by providing the concrete details through
 * a CRTP relationship.
 *
 * It expects that:
 *
 *  - the elements are identified by a zero based index,
 *  - the CRTP child provides a method that returns the number of accessible elements.
 *  - the CRTP child provides a comparator method, that uses these indices
 *  - and that the CRTP child also provides a similar swap method.
 *
 * The comparator method (compareElement) is expected to:
 *
 *  - take two indices as argument,
 *  - return a boolean that is true if the strict ordering relation holds
 *    for the two elements identified by the indices.
 *
 * The swapper (swapElement) method:
 *
 *  - takes two indices as argument,
 *  - swaps the elements, such that after it returns the elements can be
 *    found under the old indices of each other.
 *
 * The element number getter (getIndexLimit) method is required to return
 * the currently available number of elements. This number is expected to
 * be constant during the ordering operations.
 *
 * Internals
 * ---------
 *
 * The heap structure is interpreted such, that every stored element is a
 * node in a full binary tree, that has all of its levels full expcept for
 * the last one, that - depending on the current number of elements - may
 * be filled only partially. The shape of the tree is never modified by the
 * ordering operations.
 *
 * The partially ordered property of the heap data structure means that
 * every node has a smaller (or greater, depending on the comparator
 * function) value than its children. If any value is changed, or a new
 * element is introduced (on the bottom layer) the elements are swapped
 * such that this property is satisfied.
 *
 * The indices are attached to the nodes such that on each layer elements
 * are numbered from left to right with incrementing indices. On the nth
 * layer the leftmost element has the index 2^n-1  (with the root level
 * being 0) It looks like this, in the common upside down representation,
 * where the root is at the top:
 *
 *                  0
 *                /   \
 *               1     2
 *              / \   / \
 *             3   4 5   6
