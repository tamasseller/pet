/**
 * Policy based heap.
 *
 * Flexible heap implementation, that:
 *
 *	- can use an arbitrary policy for storing and selecting free blocks on allocation,
 *	- has configurable block storage overhead vs maximal allocatable size tradeoff.
 *	- has configurable alignment.
 *
 * In general a dynamic memory heap (not to be mistaken for the binary heap or min/max heap
 * data structure) takes care of the dynamic memory segment allocation from a continuous
 * memory area. Commonly it is implemented by introducing metadata inline with business
 * content. This implementation does so as well.
 *
 * The responsibilities of the heap include:
 *
 *	- keeping track of the currently unused memory,
 *	- serving allocation request so that any block of memory handed over to the
 *	  application is never assigned again, until it is released by the application,
 *	- integrating back released memory block into the free block storage.
 *
 * This task obviously requires the storage of additional metadata along with the actual
 * user content. The most scalable and common implementation scatters metadata throughout
 * the whole heap space in the form of headers before each block of memory.
 *
 * There are two different sets of information that needs to be stored along each block,
 * depending on whether it is free or used. However the used blocks header is a subset of
 * the free one's. The common metadata to be describes the location of the immediate neighbors
 * of the given block.
 *
 * @dot digraph G {
 * h[shape = plaintext, label = <<table border="0" cellborder="1" cellspacing="1"><tr>
 * 		<td port="n1">next</td><td port="p1" SIDES="TB">prev</td><td bgcolor="#90ee90">Free space</td>
 * 		<td port="n2">next</td><td port="p2" SIDES="TB">prev</td><td bgcolor="#ffc0cb">User data</td>
 * 		<td port="n3">next</td><td port="p3" SIDES="TB">prev</td><td bgcolor="#90ee90">Free space</td>
 * 		<td port="n4">next</td><td port="p4" SIDES="TB">prev</td><td bgcolor="#ffc0cb">User data</td>
 * 		<td port="n5">next</td><td port="p5" SIDES="TB">prev</td><td bgcolor="#ffc0cb">User data</td>
 * </tr></table>>]
 * h:n1:s -> h:n2:s;
 * h:n2:s -> h:n3:s;
 * h:n3:s -> h:n4:s;
 * h:n4:s -> h:n5:s;
 * h:p2:n -> h:n1:n;
 * h:p3:n -> h:n2:n;
 * h:p4:n -> h:n3:n;
 * h:p5:n -> h:n4:n;
 * } @enddot
 *
 * As these blocks cover the heapspace continuously (ie. without gaps) it is sufficient to
 * know the size of the block to get to the next one, also conversely knowing the size of
 * the previous block is. This implementation achieves the storage of the immediate neighbors'
 * location by storing the sizes instead of pointers. This is beneficial because this way the
 * sizes of the header fields depend on the maximal allowed size of a block and not on the
 * size of an arbitrary memory address. This comes in handy especially for 32bit microcontrollers,
 * where it is typical to have much less memory than the 4GB address space, so only a small
 * portion of the available space is utilized, nevertheless using pointers would require the
 * storage of the full four bytes of the address. Also the sizes are not expressed as bytes,
 * but instead shifted down by the alignment bits, to save those because otherwise they would
 * be wasted as fixed zeroes. This means that as the alignment get higher so does the
 * maximal block size.
 *
 * The heap needs to match the size of the segments to the needs of the application. Every
 * requested block has to be at least as big as the specified size, but the actually
 * allocated space can exceed the amount that was asked for. However the additional space
 * is basically wasted, because the application can only take the specified length granted,
 * so it can not use the surplus. In order for the block sizes to be as close as possible
 * to the actual needs of the application, the heap needs to slice and rejoin free blocks.
 *
 * Upon allocation the free store is queried for a block that is big enough to provide the
 * required amount of memory. If the found block is bigger (by enough) than the required
 * size, it is split and the leftover is inserted back into the free store.
 *
 * If during any operation a free block is created next to another free block they are
 * instantly joined. Obviously, used blocks can lay next to each other, but if any block
 * gets freed up, it is always checked for the possibility of merging. So this implementation
 * guarantees that there can be no pairs of adjacent free blocks, thus always counting
 * continuous free blocks as such.
 *
 * @note 	This class is directly responsible for only the tasks of splitting and joining
 * 			the blocks. The free store, including the search algorithm for adequate free
 * 			blocks is implemented by the pluggable policy. All of the operations carried out
 * 			in this class are of linear time complexity, thus preserving the possible real-time
 * 			characteristics of the supplied policy.
 *
 * @warning This heap implementation is not guarded for **concurrent accesses** in itself. If it
 *			is used in multi-threaded/interrupt context **locking has to be added externally**.
 *
 * @see		TlsfPolicy.h
 *
 * @tparam	Policy the free block storage/selection policy to be incorporated.
 * @tparam	SizeType the (unsigned integral) type to be used for the internal
 * 			representation of sizes, this parameter tunes the storage overhead
 * 			against the maximal size of blocks.
 * @tparam	alignmentBits The number of **bits** of alignment. That
 * 			is the low bits that an address needs to have zeroed
 * 			out to satisfy the alignment criterion.
 * @tparam	useChecksum If true the static part of the heap blocks are checksummed
 * 			and before every access to a block its checksum is validated. Reports
 * 			error through the Trace<AllHeapsTrace>. If false the checks are optimized
 * 			away.
