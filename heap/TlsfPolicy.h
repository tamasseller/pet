/**
 * Two-level segregated fit allocator policy.
 *
 * This is a dynamic memory management policy for Heap host class. Together they
 * form a real-time heap, capable of allocating and reclaiming a full or partial
 * block with constant time complexity considering the whole internal state of
 * the heap. That is, the upper limit of the time it takes to carry out the
 * operation is a fixed constant, no matter how many or how small free/used
 * blocks there are in the free store.
 *
 * It achieves this predictability by never iterating over the stored elements.
 * Instead it employs a hash-table like structure where buckets are assigned
 * according to the block sizes. This assignment is done in a logarithmic-then-linear
 * fashion, so smaller sized blocks are distinguished more accurately. Upon an
 * allocation request such a bucket is selected that is known to contain blocks
 * that have a size greater or equal to requested one. It is always the first
 * block that is removed from that list.
 *
 * It can be seen that for the first few (32 for this implementation) slots
 * this scheme is optimally accurate, for bigger sizes the precision
 * logarithmically decreases. As the blocks that are too small to be split
 * are served optimally there is no waste introduced by this technique.
 * Larger sized blocks can be split so the leftover space can be reused.
 * However the fragmentation may be increased slightly by the imprecise matches,
 * but in practice the effect is negligible.
 *
 * Adding an item to the store is done by first determining the bucket for the
 * size then adding the new element to the beginning of the list.
 * During block merges the Heap host may request the deletion of an arbitrary
 * entry from this data structure, so to be able to that in constant time the
 * lists of the buckets need to be linked in both directions.
 *
 * @see http://www.gii.upv.es/tlsf/files/ecrts04_tlsf.pdf for the original papaer.
