/**
 * A return value that can represent an error.
 *
 * This class template enables versatile test scenarious related to error handling. Any method can
 * wrap its return value into a failable by specifying the wrapped type and the values that
 * represent an exceptional state. If the user of the method does not check the returned value
 * explicitly for an error condition before using it , then - in a test build - a failure is induced.
 *
 * It is implemented in such a way that if the DebugConfig.h does not specify an error handler it
 * gets optimized away completely, that is the resulting code will be about the same as if the
 * wrapped type would have been used directly.
 *
 * It works internally like a shared_ptr, when it is created it allocates a small structure, that
 * holds a reference count and another variable representing if it was checked. The Failable itself
 * holds a pointer to that object. Any time a Failable is copied, the pointer is copied over and
 * the reference count is incremented. When it is destroyed the reference count is decremented
 * and if it reaches zero, then the flag is checked. If the error has not been checked until this
 * point, the alarm is triggered.
 *
 * @note This class is supposed to be used through the typedef ubiq::Failable.
 *
 * @tparam	Value			The wrapped type.
 * @tparam	Specific		CRTP style client that has to inherit from this class and
 * 							supply a bool isError() non-static method that returns true
 * 							if the current value is an error code. The method has to be
 * 							accessible from the FailableBase.
 * @tparam	ErrorReporter 	Internal parameter used for hacks related optimizing out
 * 							the additional code and the pointer for the error checking
 * 							helper struct if there is no reporter.
