/**
 * Lock-free circular buffer index manager.
 *
 * This class provides data placement management logic for First In
 * First Out buffers. It can be used by a **single reader** and a
 * **single writer** concurrently without any locking.
 * Locking is not required due to the fact that:
 *
 *  - a. the _reader index_ is only modified by the reader,
 *  - b. the _writer index_ is only modified by the writer,
 *  - c. both only modify their side atomically as seen by the other.
 *
 *  Circular buffers, that represent their state in the form of reader and
 *  writer pointers (as opposed to start pointer and size) bear that property
 *  by nature, but the presented implementation also utilizes the available
 *  buffer fully, that is the last byte is not lost as it would be with the
 *  trivial naive read/write pointer implementation.
 *
 *  The problem of lost byte is rooted in the ambiguity between the full and
 *  empty states: if the reader and writer indices were simple array indices
 *  than these logical states would yield the same representation.
 *
 *  This slight inefficiency is mitigated by enabling the indices to take
 *  values not only between zero and the size of the array minus one, but
 *  instead the interval is doubled. Whenever the data elements are required
 *  to be addressed the reader/writer indices are modulo reduced by the size
 *  of the array. By enabling them to use the doubled intervals the empty
 *  and full states can easily be differentiated. The FIFO buffer is
 *  empty when the indices are equal, and it is full when the writer is
 *  ahead of the reader by exactly the size of the buffer.
