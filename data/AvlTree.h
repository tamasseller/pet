 * Self balancing in-memory binary search tree.

 * An implementation of the [AVL tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) algorithm.
 * Extends the functionality of the BinaryTree with the possibility to add and remove elements.
 * A compromise is made between managing the shape of the tree to stay as spread out as possible
 * and minimizing the operations needed for the add and remove operations. The AVL algorithm and
 * the [Red-black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) are the two most
 * commonly used self-balancing tree algorithms. For most cases they perform roughly equally,
 * however elaborated benchmarks show that AVL tree is better if the access pattern is read hevy
 * because it is slightly slower to modify the tree than it is with the RB tree however it results
 * in a more spread out tree.
