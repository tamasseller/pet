	 * to be inserted.
	 *
	 * It contains:

	 *  - a pointer to the parent node if there is any
	 *  - and a pointer to the pointer that is to be pointed at the node.
	 *
	 * There are several different configurations regarding the validity and
	 * meaning of these pointers:
	 *
	 *  1. The found element is the root or if an empty tree is traversed:
	 *
	 *    - there is no parent,
	 *    - the back reference (origin) is the _root_ pointer of the tree.
	 *
	 *  2. The node is found and is not the root of the tree:
	 *
	 *    - the parent pointer is set to the nodes parent,
	 *    - the origin points to either the _small_ or _big_ pointer of
	 *      the parent, in accordance with the actual configuration of
	 *      the found node and its parent.
	 *
	 *  3. The node is not found:
	 *
	 *    - the parent pointer points at the leaf where the search terminated,
	 *    - the origin is set the same way as above.
	 *
	 * In all cases, this object provides sufficient information for:
	 *
	 *  - finding a node or determining its absence,
	 *  - deleting a node that is found,
	 *  - adding a new node that is not found.
